\title{Projects fitted plug-and-play distribution models onto new covariates.}
\usage{
project_plug_and_play(pnp_model, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{pnp_model}{A fitted plug-and-play model produced by \code{fit_plug_and_play}}

\item{data}{covariate data}
}
\value{
A vector of relative occurrence rates evaluated at the covariates supplied in the data object.
}
\description{
This function projects fitted plug-and-play species distribution models onto new covariates.
}
\note{
The tsearchn function underlying rangebagging seems to fail sometimes with very uneven predictors. Rescaling helps.
